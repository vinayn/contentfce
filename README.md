Adding structured content in typo3 and exporting the content in DITA format

Note : While saving the Dita content FCE use 'Save button'. If 'Save and close' is used the content will get duplicacted in the backend layout section and will be lost on saving the content FCE. This is due to the unique identifier not being created while doing 'Save and close' by Flux. The issue is related to Flux extension
